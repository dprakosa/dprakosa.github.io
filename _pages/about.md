Hi there :wave: My name is Danar and I am a programming enthusiast with a keen interest in [competitive](https://codeforces.com/profile/qualia) [programming](https://atcoder.jp/users/qualia). Currently, I am learning the basics of `web development`. During my free time, I enjoy playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/dsupathcompression), watching [films](https://boxd.it/clhUG), and playing classical guitar. If you share my passion for learning and creating, I would be delighted to connect with you - feel free to [reach out](https://www.instagram.com/dnr_pra/) to me anytime for a chat!
