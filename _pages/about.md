Hi there :wave: My name is Danar and I am a programming enthusiast with a **strong** passion for [competitive](https://codeforces.com/profile/qualia) [programming](https://atcoder.jp/users/qualia). I have always been fascinated by the problem-solving nature of programming and its diverse applications. Currently, I am focusing on learning the fundamentals of `web development`, as I believe that the web is a rapidly growing field with a lot of exciting opportunities.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/dsupathcompression), watching [films](https://boxd.it/clhUG), or playing classical guitar. I am always looking to connect with other like-minded individuals who share my passion for programming, so feel free to [reach out](https://www.instagram.com/dnr_pra/) if you want to chat!
